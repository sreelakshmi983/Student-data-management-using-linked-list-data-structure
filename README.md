# Student-data-management-using-linked-list-data-structure
Developed a menu-driven Student Record Management System in C using singly linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, file handling, searching, sorting, modification, deletion, and record management. 

A modular, menu-driven C application that manages student data using a Singly Linked List data structure 1 . The system handles dynamic memory allocation, persistent storage via binary file I/O, linked list manipulations (reversal, sorting), searching, and input validation.
Features:
Auto Roll-Number Assignment: Dynamically assigns the smallest available positive integer as a unique roll number.
Flexible Search & Modification: Modify records by searching via Roll Number, Name, or Percentage.
Selective Deletion: Delete specific records by Roll Number or Name.
In-Memory Operations:
Sort: Alphabetically by name or descending by percentage.
Reverse: In-place pointer reversal of the singly linked list.
Clear: Bulk delete all nodes in memory.
Data Persistence: Automatic load on startup and manual/exit options to save to student.dat.
Memory Safe: Dynamic memory allocation (malloc) and full deallocation (free) on deletion or exit to prevent memory leaks.
